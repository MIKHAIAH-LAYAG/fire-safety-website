            <p>
                Fire prevention is the first and most important step in ensuring safety. Fires are often caused

            <h2>Steps to Take During a Fire Emergency</h2>
            <p>
                In the unfortunate event of a fire, staying calm and acting quickly is crucial. Here are the 
                detailed steps to ensure your safety:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    **Sound the Alarm**: Immediately alert everyone in the building. If there’s no fire alarm, 
                    shout "Fire!" to warn others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Call for Help**: Dial your local emergency hotline or fire department. Provide clear 
                    information about the location and severity of the fire.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Evacuate Safely**: Follow the nearest exit and avoid going back for belongings. Time is 
                    critical during a fire.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Stay Low**: If smoke is present, crawl on the ground to avoid inhaling toxic fumes. 
                    Cover your nose and mouth with a damp cloth if possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Do Not Re-Enter**: Once you are safely outside, stay out. Wait for firefighters to handle 
                    the situation.
                </li>
            </ol>
